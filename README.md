The goal of the [**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/) package
is to provide a flexible framework for making inference via permutation.
The idea is to promote the permutation framework as an incredibly
well-suited tool for inference on complex data. You supply your data, as
complex as it might be, in the form of lists in which each entry stores
one data point in a representation that suits you and
[**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/) takes care of the
permutation magic and provides you with either point estimates or
confidence regions or $p$-value of hypothesis tests. Permutation tests
are especially appealing because they are exact no matter how small or
big your sample sizes are. You can also use the so-called
*non-parametric combination* approach in this setting to combine several
statistics to better target the alternative hypothesis you are testing
against. Asymptotic consistency is also guaranteed under mild conditions
on the statistic you use. The
[**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/) package provides a
flexible permutation framework for making inference such as point
estimation, confidence intervals or hypothesis testing, on any kind of
data, be it univariate, multivariate, or more complex such as
network-valued data, topological data, functional data or density-valued
data.

## Installation

You can install the package from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
with:

``` r
install.packages("flipr")
```

Alternatively, You can install the development version of
[**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/) from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("permaverse/flipr")
```

## Example

``` r
library(flipr)
```

We hereby use the very simple t-test for comparing the means of two
univariate samples to show how easy it is to carry out a permutation
test with [**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/).

### Data generation

Let us first generate two samples of size $15$ governed by Gaussian
distributions with equal variance but different means:

``` r
set.seed(123)
n <- 15
x <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 1, sd = 1)
```

Given the data we simulated, the parameter of interest here is the
difference between the means of the distributions, say
$\delta = \mu_y - \mu_x$.

### Make the two samples exchangeable under $H_0$

In the context of null hypothesis testing, we consider the null
hypothesis $H_0: \mu_y - \mu_x = \delta$. We can use a permutation
scheme to approach the $p$-value if the two samples are *exchangeable*
under $H_0$. This means that we need to transform for example the second
sample to *make* it exchangeable with the first sample under $H_0$. In
this simple example, this can be achieved as follows. Let
$X_1, \dots, X_{n_x} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, 1)$ and
$Y_1, \dots, Y_{n_y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_y, 1)$. We can then transform
the second sample as $Y_i \longleftarrow Y_i - \delta$.

We can define a proper function to do this, termed the *null
specification* function, which takes two input arguments:

- `y` which is a list storing the data points in the second sample;
- `parameters` which is a numeric vector of values for the parameters
  under investigation (here only $\delta$ and thus `parameters` is of
  length $1$ with `parameters[1] = delta`).

In our simple example, it boils down to:

``` r
null_spec <- function(y, parameters) {
  purrr::map(y, ~ .x - parameters[1])
}
```

### Choose suitable test statistics

Next, we need to decide which test statistic(s) we are going to use for
performing the test. Here, we are only interested in one parameter,
namely the mean difference $\delta$. Since the two samples share the
same variance, we can use for example the $t$-statistic with a pooled
estimate of the common variance.

This statistic can be easily computed using
`stats::t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)$statistic`. However, we want to
extend its evaluation to any permuted version of the data. Test
statistic functions compatible with
[**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/) should have at least
two mandatory input arguments:

- `data` which is either a concatenated list of size $n_x + n_y$
  regrouping the data points of both samples or a distance matrix of
  size $(n_x + n_y) \times (n_x + n_y)$ stored as an object of class
  `dist`.
- `indices1` which is an integer vector of size $n_x$ storing the
  indices of the data points belonging to the first sample in the
  current permuted version of the data.

Some test statistics are already implemented in
[**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/) and ready to use.
User-defined test statistics can be used as well, with the use of the
helper function `use_stat(nsamples = 2, stat_name = )`. This function
creates and saves an `.R` file in the `R/` folder of the current working
directory and populates it with the following template:

``` r
#' Test Statistic for the Two-Sample Problem
#'
#' This function computes the test statistic...
#'
#' @param data A list storing the concatenation of the two samples from which
#'   the user wants to make inference. Alternatively, a distance matrix stored
#'   in an object of class \code{\link[stats]{dist}} of pairwise distances
#'   between data points.
#' @param indices1 An integer vector that contains the indices of the data
#'   points belong to the first sample in the current permuted version of the
#'   data.
#'
#' @return A numeric value evaluating the desired test statistic.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' # TO BE DONE BY THE DEVELOPER OF THE PACKAGE
stat_{{{name}}} <- function(data, indices1) {
  n <- if (inherits(data, "dist"))
    attr(data, "Size")
  else if (inherits(data, "list"))
    length(data)
  else
    stop("The `data` input should be of class either list or dist.")

  indices2 <- seq_len(n)[-indices1]

  x <- data[indices1]
  y <- data[indices2]

  # Here comes the code that computes the desired test
  # statistic from input samples stored in lists x and y

}
```

For instance, a
[**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/)-compatible version of
the $t$-statistic with pooled variance will look like:

``` r
my_t_stat <- function(data, indices1) {
  n <- if (inherits(data, "dist"))
    attr(data, "Size")
  else if (inherits(data, "list"))
    length(data)
  else
    stop("The `data` input should be of class either list or dist.")

  indices2 <- seq_len(n)[-indices1]

  x <- data[indices1]
  y <- data[indices2]
  
  # Here comes the code that computes the desired test
  # statistic from input samples stored in lists x and y
  x <- unlist(x)
  y <- unlist(y)
  
  stats::t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)$statistic
}
```

Here, we are only going to use the $t$-statistic for this example, but
we might be willing to use more than one statistic for a parameter or we
might have several parameters under investigation, each one of them
requiring a different test statistic. We therefore group all the test
statistics that we need into a single list:

``` r
stat_functions <- list(my_t_stat)
```

### Assign test statistics to parameters

Finally we need to define a named list that tells
[**flipr**](https://permaverse.github.io/flipr/) which test statistics
among the ones declared in the `stat_functions` list should be used for
each parameter under investigation. This is used to determine bounds on
each parameter for the plausibility function. This list, often termed
`stat_assignments`, should therefore have as many elements as there are
parameters under investigation. Each element should be named after a
parameter under investigation and should list the indices corresponding
to the test statistics that should be used for that parameter in
`stat_functions`. In our example, it boils down to:

``` r
stat_assignments <- list(delta = 1)
```

### Use the plausibility function

Now we can instantiate a plausibility function as follows:

``` r
pf <- PlausibilityFunction$new(
  null_spec = null_spec,
  stat_functions = stat_functions,
  stat_assignments = stat_assignments,
  x, y
)
#> ! Setting the seed for sampling permutations is mandatory for obtaining a continuous p-value function. Using `seed = 1234`.
```

Now, assume we want to test the following hypotheses:

$$ H_0: \delta = 0 \quad \mbox{v.s.} \quad H_1: \delta \ne 0. $$

We use the `$get_value()` method for this purpose, which essentially
evaluates the permutation $p$-value of a two-sided test by default:

``` r
pf$get_value(0)
#> [1] 0.1078921
```

We can compare the resulting $p$-value with the one obtained using the
more classic parametric test:

``` r
t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)$p.value
#> [1] 0.1030946
```

The permutation $p$-value does not quite match the parametric one. This
is because of two reasons:

1.  The resolution of a permutation $p$-value is of the order of
    $1/(B+1)$, where $B$ is the number of sampled permutations. By
    default, the plausibility function is instantiated with $B = 1000$:

``` r
pf$nperms
#> [1] 1000
```

2.  We randomly sample $B$ permutations out of the
    $\binom{n_x+n_y}{n_x}$ possible permutations and therefore introduce
    extra variability in the $p$-value.

If we were to ask for more permutations, say $B = 1,000,000$, we would
be much closer to the parametric $p$-value:

``` r
pf$set_nperms(1000000)
pf$get_value(0)
#> [1] 0.1029879
```
